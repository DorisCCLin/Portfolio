    				<div class="pastbio" id="hover-content">I was born in Taiwan but now calls Philly home. I was a set designer in theater when I was in college. Later, I received my MFA in Film & Media Arts from Temple University. I writes, produces and directs films as a filmmaker while keeping my passion in production design as a art designer. In 2014, she started Spirit Animal Collective, a creative media production studio with friends and continues her career in filmmaking and art design. Coming from creative background allows me to think outside of the box and create interesting and innovative projects. It also keeps me open-minded and flexible to all possible solutions when it comes to more complex problems.</div>

    				<div class="presentbio" id="hover-content">While I was pursuing my education, I self-taught web development skills and was a web master at school. Since then, I have grown my great interest in tech constantly. After graduation, I formed a media production studio to help my clients to produce media products like videos, websites and apps. Without formal training in computer science, oftentimes I had to collaborate with other more experienced engineers to create the satisfying products for clients. Gradually, I realized that my interest in tech have drove me to commit to a different career path as a developer. Currently I am attending New York Code + Design Academy.</div>
